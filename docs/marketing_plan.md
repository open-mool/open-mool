# Open Mool: Go-to-Market Strategy (Open Source)

## Overview
This document outlines the launch and growth strategy for the **Open Mool** repository and platform. Our goal is to position this not essentially as a "product", but as a **movement**—a digital public utility for the Himalayas.

## 1. Target Audiences

### A. The Builders (Developers & Open Source Contributors)
*   **Persona:** React/Next.js developers, AI enthusiasts, Cloudflare/Edge computing nerds.
*   **Value Prop:** "Work on a modern, bleeding-edge stack (AI + Edge) for a cause that actually matters."
*   **Call to Action:** Star the repo, fix a `good-first-issue`, join the Discord.

### B. The Guardians (Individual Contributors)
*   **Persona:** Trekkers, travel photographers, anthropologists, local heritage enthusiasts.
*   **Value Prop:** "Your hard drive is where photos go to die. Make your travels immortal. Contribute to history."
*   **Call to Action:** Create an account, upload your first story, earn "Scout" status.

### C. The Pillars (NGOs & Institutions)
*   **Persona:** Cultural trusts, Himalayan museums, Universities (e.g., Ladakh Arts Council).

## 2. Launch Channels

### A. GitHub (The HQ)
*   **Optimization:**
    *   Professional `README.md` with high-quality assets.
    *   Clear `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
    *   "Good First Issue" labels populated for newcomers.
*   **Launch:** Post on `r/opensource`, `r/reactjs`, and Hacker News.
*   **KPI:** 100 Stars in Week 1.

### B. "The Trek" (Content Marketing)
*   **Blog/Substack:** "Building Open Mool." Technical deep-dives (e.g., *"How we built an AI-native archive on Cloudflare Edge"*).
*   **Twitter/X:** Build in public. Share specific "gems" found in the archive (e.g., an old song from Spiti). Use tags like `#BuildInPublic`, `#OpenSource`, `#Himalayas`.

### C. Partner Outreach (Direct Sales)
*   Identify top 5 cultural NGOs in HP/Uttarakhand/Ladakh.
*   Offer a white-glove onboarding: "We will upload your first 100GB for free."
*   **Goal:** Secure 2 Launch Partners to populate the seed data.

## 3. The "Decentralization" Narrative
To maintain trust while keeping control of the core platform quality:
*   **Messaging:** "We are the stewards, not the owners."
*   **Strategy:** Emphasize that the *code* is yours (the community's), and the *data* is protected by the Foundation.
*   **Long-term:** Tease "Project Mirror" — tools for anyone to run a read-only node of the data.
